# CIT480SeniorProject
Project files for CIT480 Senior Design

Our application is composed of app.py as well as two directories.
The static directory contains the style.css file and the templates directory
contains base.html and home.html.

To run the app locally on your machine:
You will need to have python installed as well as a few other modules:

flask (web)
pandas (Dataframes)
folium (Mapping)
requests (API Calls)

These packages can be installed by using PIP which is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages.

How to use PIP:
sudo -H pip3 install pandas

Command to run the application:
python3 app.py

This will create a running web application on the localhost:
http://127.0.0.1:5000
